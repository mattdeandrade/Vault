//pseudo code: assign each number in the combination
//an expression that evaulates into the appropriate
//value. Be sure to use each operator "+, -, *, /" at
//least once.
//first number = 40 - 10 - 10 - 10 (saves 10 to first)
//second number = 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 (saves 40 to second)
//third number = 10 / 10 * 39 (saves 39 to third)
//save the required string to "message"
//use the alert to print message + vault combo, and
//remember to include spacing.
